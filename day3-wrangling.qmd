## Recreate this plot!

I will show a plot on the google slides. This plot was created using the data verbs in class. Working with your partner, see if you can construct a series of pipes to recreate the plot. Here is some code to get you started:

```{r}
# Location of the excel file:
url <- 'https://github.com/jmzobitz/DST490Datasets/raw/main/Unemployment.xlsx'

# Name of the file to save:
destfile <- "Unemployment.xlsx"

# Download
curl::curl_download(url, destfile)
input_data <- readxl::read_excel(destfile,
                                        skip = 4,
                                        sheet = 'UnemploymentMedianIncome')

glimpse(input_data)

```
